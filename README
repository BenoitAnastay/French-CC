A (bad) french locale/translation of CrossCode.

It's far from being complete, and let's not talk about its quality.

Feedback and testing are welcome.  Suggestions for better translations
are welcome, as are snarky remarks from grammar cops.

Installing:

To use this mod:
- Install it in a sub-directory in assets/mods
  (the name of the directory is not important)
- Install Localize-me[1] in assets/mods too.
- Either install CCLoader[2] or CCInjector[3], at your discretion.

[1] https://github.com/L-Sherry/Localize-me
[2] https://github.com/CCDirectLink/CCLoader
[3] https://github.com/CCDirectLink/CCInjector
    you also need the mod-validator plugin for CCInjector,
    if you haven't installed it already:

Contributing:

To view/recreate translations packs in this mod, you can simply clone this
repository and use the provided makefile as follow (you can omit gamedir=
if this mod is already installed under assets/mods):

make generate gamedir="/path/to/the/crosscode/assets/"

Will attempt to generate a big JSON file under translation/french_translation.js
that you can either edit with a text editor, or add more translations using
jsontr.py from Localize-Me-Tools, available at:

https://github.com/L-Sherry/Localize-Me-Tools

You can then use 'make gamedir=...' to update the files in packs/ and commit
them.

If you can't use the makefile for some reason, then read it, it's not
that complicated (erm).

A quick introduction on how to use `jsontr.py` is available here:
