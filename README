A (bad) french locale/translation of CrossCode.

It's far from being complete, and let's not talk about its quality.

Feedback and testing are welcome.  Suggestions for better translations
are welcome, as are snarky remarks from grammar cops.

CCLoader and Localize-me are required to use it.

Contributing:

To view/recreate translations packs in this mod, you can simply clone this
repository and use the provided makefile as follow:

make generate gamedir="/path/to/the/crosscode/assets/"

Will attempt to generate a big JSON file under translation/french_translation.js
that you can either edit with a text editor, or add more translations using
jsontr.py from Localize-Me-Tools.

You can then use 'make gamedir=...' to update the files in packs/ and commit
them.

If you can't use the makefile for some reason, then read it, it's not
that complicated (erm).
